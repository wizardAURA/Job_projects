Flutter Food Order App üçï
A single-workflow food ordering application built with Flutter. This project demonstrates a clean, scalable, and testable mobile app architecture using the BLoC pattern for state management. The entire user journey, from selecting a restaurant to confirming an order, is implemented with a focus on SOLID principles and a great user experience.

‚ú® Features
Browse Restaurants: Fetches and displays a list of local restaurants from a mock repository.

View Menus: Select a restaurant to view its detailed menu.

Dynamic Cart: Add or remove items from the cart with real-time updates to the total price.

Place an Order: A simulated order placement process with loading and success/error states.

Order Confirmation: A clean and simple confirmation screen after a successful order.

Robust Error Handling: Implemented error states with a "Try Again" option for data-fetching failures.

üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Tech Stack
This project was built with a modern and robust architecture to ensure separation of concerns and testability.

State Management: BloC (Business Logic Component) using the flutter_bloc package to manage the state of the application in a predictable and reactive way.

Architecture: Clean Architecture principles with a feature-first folder structure. The code is divided into three main layers:

Data Layer: Handles data models and the mock repository that simulates API calls.

Business Logic Layer: Contains all the BLoCs and Cubits that manage the app's state.

Presentation Layer: Contains all the UI components (screens and widgets).

SOLID Principles: The codebase is structured to adhere to the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

Testing: Unit Tests for all BLoCs and Cubits using bloc_test and mockito to ensure the business logic is reliable and bug-free.

Dependency Injection: RepositoryProvider and BlocProvider are used to provide dependencies down the widget tree.

Design: A custom, aesthetically pleasing theme using Material Design components and google_fonts.
